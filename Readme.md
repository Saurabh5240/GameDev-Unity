Hi there!!!

Here I upload basic unity projects with simple mechanics which you can look.  
To View these projects in unity follow these steps---  
1)Download the files (.unitypackage)  
2)Open a new unity project  
3)Go to assets then import package then custom package  
4)select this downloaded file and open the file and open the scene.     
5)The project is ready for you to use from project section window.     
(Note - I have been uploading the scripts for each game as well for coding reference of what goes inside the game).
