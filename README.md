Hi there!!!
Here I upload basic unity projects with simple mechanics which you can look.
To View these projects in unity follow these steps---
1)Download the files (.unitypackage)
2)Open a new unity project
3)Go to assets then import package then custom package
4)select this downloaded file and open the file
5)The project is ready for you to use from project section window.
